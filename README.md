# What & Why
This is a "Lite" version of the [BlazorDemoCRUD](https://github.com/shadowlings/BlazorDemoCRUD) project. This lite version has no external dependencies. No SQL DB. No Authentication/Authorization. Why? It is enables rapid prototyping and demoing. You can clone this project and start it up right away. The DB has been replaced with an "In Memory" database. The in memory DB will not persist across application shutdown/restarts. This project still shows all the basic CRUD & search opertions.

## Demo
To demo this app, simply clone it and run it. To run it, run this command in the "Server" folder: 'dotnet watch'
